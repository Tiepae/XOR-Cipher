# XOR-Cipher
A small simple C project implementing a XOR chipher. Focuses on user input handling, loops, and basic crytographic concepts.

I took a software security class a few semesters ago and became curious about how basic ciphers work. I wanted to see if I could build one myself, so I chose an XOR cipher since it was one of the methods discussed in class.
This program uses a simple menu system that lets the user encrypt or decrypt text using XOR. If you run into input issues, the help option explains how to format your entries.

This project was accomplished using VS Code.
